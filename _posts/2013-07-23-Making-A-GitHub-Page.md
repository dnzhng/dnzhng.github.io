##Part 1
####Why GitHub?

[After writing some of this post, I realized how long it will be, so I am dividing it into parts.]

It seems only fitting that my first posts be about the making of this page. 

When I discovered that GitHub hosted pages for free, I was incredibly happy. As a member of the "poor college student" demographic, I was a little wary of buying a domain/paying for a service to host my page. Now, I understand that it's a great investment, and I will most likely be doing something similar in the future, but for now I do not see a custom domain, and the like, as necessary.

When I first decided I wanted to make a personal page, I looked in to free website builders such as Wix, and Striking.ly. For those who do not know, these pages allow you to create beautiful pages fairly easily.However, after playing around with them for a little I felt that I was cheating myself out of the experience of building something from scratch. Despite having known basic HTML and CSS syntax for a while, I never had any opportunities to put them in to practice. The laziness in me always settled for pre-made templates on sites like Wix, or even Tumblr. I mean, if they were already there, why not use them, right? 

However, this time, as I delved more into different aspects of coding and development, I realized that the best way that I learn something is to just do it, rather than just reading about it. Thus, I told myself to build a page on my own, and GitHub pages seemed to offer the best medium of doing so. I already had an account (which I rarely used, another reason for me to make my page on GitHub), so I just looked up how to create one, and it was made. 

####Beginnings

Just kidding, it really wasn't that easy (overall, it took me a little more than a week). As a person fairly unfamiliar with GitHub, and Git itself, I had to clumsily find my way. The first iteration of the page, I stupidly chose the option of picking from a premade template that used Jekyll. Now, at the time I had no idea what Jekyll was, but I thought that a template would be a good place to start, so I picked one I liked...

And immediately proceeded to delete the repository that I had just made. Seriously, I was going against the very philosophy of building my own page from scratch that I had started with. Moreover, as I looked at all of the random folders/documents that had populated my repo, I got more confused and decided it would be better to start from a clean slate. So I followed the instructions on the "Create a Project Page Manually" page, and for a while I had a nice, plain-text page, saying "My GitHub Page." 

As an aside, I will explain that I was making this page along with taking a class and working full time, so I could only work on it for 1-2 hours a night, at best. 

Anyways, I only had one thing in my mind for the page, and that was Parallax scrolling. Moreover, I decided to use Bootstrap, because I understood that it provided a lot of usefull tools that would make building a site much easier, but more on these later. I was also curious about Jekyll, considering GitHub pages have Jekyll support built in. However, I read that Jekyll was limited to static pages, and, not sure what that exactly meant, I was afraid that I would be limited by Jekyll (I quickly learned otherwise). Moreover, I figured all GitHub pages would be built with Jekyll, so I endeavoured to build my page using only Bootstrap. 

I will continue with what happened in my next post, stay tuned!
