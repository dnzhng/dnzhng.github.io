##Part 2
####Bootstrap/Parallax

I started out using Bootstrap. Of course, I only knew what it was by name, so I simply downloaded the entire package, without any custom CSS that I could have used. Quite honestly though, I only really wanted the navigation bar, and what ended up happening in the final product was that I just used Bootstrap for the grid system. 

Nonetheless, I was Bootstrapped up, and I wanted to use parallax scrolling. So after googling around, I found a nice Parallax demo by mode87.com that was pretty much built for bootstrap. Equipped with my weapons, I got down to business with creating my web page. 

I also wanted to use my page as a way to promote another passion of mine: photography. Every photo seen on this web page was taken by me. As I was working, I used the template provided by mode87 to create my own "sections" in the page, each with it's own photo. Unfortunately, when I was testing the page, it was loading very slowly, most likely due to all of the pictures it had to load. This was the first strike against parallax scrolling (at the time I attributed the slow loading to the scrolling, I mean, how could my pictures cause my page to falter?). 

The second strike against parallax was more personal rather than technical. As I was creating the page, it became very difficult for me to fill it with any content. Talking about myself is definitely one of my weak points, and I found it very difficult to present myself in a way that fit the page. It was around this time that I started thinking about making simply a blog, where I could write about certain technical projects that I had; I knew I would be working on a bunch for school. 

Thd third strike against parallax was simply that it did not look that good. It was a kind of cool effect, but in part because I implemented such a simple version of it, and in part because I probably did not implement it well, I felt that the parallax did not add anything to it. Compounded with the slow loading it just got really annoying, so I decided that making a blog would be the way to go. 

####Enter Jekyll

It was around this time that I was learning more about Jekyll and how powerful of a tool it could be. I started to take out sections of my code to replace with Jekyll code. While this may not be so useful, considering I only really have a single page, I know that this modularity will make developing this page even easier. Thus, I had a new design idea in mind for my blog, which is the one you see now. HTML/CSS wise, it is pretty basic, using Bootstrap's grid to maintain the sidebar width and the body width. Obviously, there is not much content yet, but I have unfortunately not been able to work on this that much. 

####Future Plans
A to-do list for what I need to do: 
1. Make the site more responsive
2. Update more regularly
3. Perhaps add a photoblog portion. 
4. Clean up the repository.
